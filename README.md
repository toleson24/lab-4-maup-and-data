# Lab 4: Data and MAUP

## About

You will pick a state from [Redistricting Data Hub](https://redistrictingdatahub.
org/) and create a shapefile using the MAUP tools that we explored in class. I’d like you
to each do a different state, if possible. Please claim a state [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Kw_A5zSzgIXStXgYJWFj6dibwv1j7TXZ1xce44FpAI/edit?usp=drive_link). In order to complete this assignment you must:  
1. Create a shapefile for your state that can be run by gerrychain  
2. This shapefile must have at least three kinds of data, ideally on precincts (although blocks is OK too):
	a. Total population (although you can add more refined populations!)  
	b. Election outcome for at least one election (although you can add more than one election!)  
	c. District data for a map with at least 5 districts (can be congressional, state lower, or state upper . . . but you can have more than one!)  
3. Please show that your shapefile can be run by gerrychain by importing it and running a short chain on it.  
Please know that you will likely run into issues! Most likely this will be maps with bad geometries. If you’re unable to rectify your first state, please try another (be sure to update your state [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Kw_A5zSzgIXStXgYJWFj6dibwv1j7TXZ1xce44FpAI/edit?usp=drive_link)). If you are unsuccessful on two states, please try another but let me know that you’re doing so. If you fail on three, let me know and you can probably hand in a file showing how and why you failed three times.  
Do your best to write code as cleanly as possible, with well-named variables.
